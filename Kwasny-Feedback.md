Dear Devanshi,

I am incredibly impressed with your poetry project! Your approach to the assignment is both outstanding and creative. Using conversational text message language gives your work a distinct voice that resonates with readers. Additionally, the use of a large image with compact text at the bottom creates a visually appealing composition that draws readers in.

I particularly appreciated how you used hyperlinks in your project. Your decision to display the entire URL instead of shortening it helped reshape the way I think about sharing websites and videos with my friends. Your attention to detail and careful consideration of design choices is truly impressive.

Congratulations on a job well done! Keep up the excellent work.
