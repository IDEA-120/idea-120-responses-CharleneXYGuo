After listening to Murray's analysis, I found her predictions regarding internet television and virtual environments like VR to be extremely accurate. Entertainment is one of the many purposes that the internet serves, and with streaming services such as Netflix, Paramount, and Hulu, audiences are able to enjoy shows set in virtual environments that they may not be able to experience in real life. These shows, such as Supernatural, Marvel movies, and the Mandalorian, boast stunning special effects that capture the audience's attention and leave them entranced. It's fascinating to see how these virtual environments have become so captivating and integral to modern entertainment.
