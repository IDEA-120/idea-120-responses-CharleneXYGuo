Cathy O’Neil, in her book, highlights the concept of “math destruction” and an example of this could be an algorithm used to assess a teacher's effectiveness solely based on their students’ test scores. This approach to evaluating teachers would not be effective as it fails to account for the various factors that can impact a student’s performance. Such an algorithm may penalize a teacher who may have had a classroom with students who have unique circumstances or face learning difficulties. As a result, such an approach could lead to unfair outcomes, such as a teacher being fired despite their competence in teaching. It's essential to consider the complexities involved in measuring teacher effectiveness and not rely solely on simplistic, mathematically-driven algorithms.
