The internet has become a place where targeted advertising has become the norm, but at what cost? While it may seem convenient to receive ads tailored to our interests, it can also be a dangerous tool used to manipulate and exploit vulnerable individuals. O’Neil’s example of for-profit universities targeting low-income students with ads is just one example of how targeted advertising can perpetuate systemic inequalities.

Moreover, when it comes to the targeting of younger generations, we must be especially careful. The example of young people playing Call of Duty and then being bombarded with ads for joining the military is a perfect illustration of how targeted advertising can be used to exploit and manipulate people's interests. By using one's interests to push them towards a certain agenda, we risk leading people down paths that are not truly aligned with their best interests.

Therefore, it is crucial that we start to question and regulate the way that targeted advertising is used online. We need to ensure that individuals are not being targeted in a way that exploits their vulnerabilities, but rather that they are given access to information that is truthful and unbiased. It is only through this kind of regulation that we can hope to create a more egalitarian and fair internet for all.
